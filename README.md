# Bashellit

**Bashellit** is a lightweight editor dedicated to writing Bash scripts on Linux.

There are already excellent IDEs and editors available, such as VS Code, but they often come with a large footprint and many features that are unnecessary when your only goal is to write simple shell scripts. Bashellit was born out of that frustration: the need for a focused, minimal tool that does one thing well.

Bashellit provides a clean environment to edit, and organize all your Bash scripts in one place. You just have to import your scripts.

## Philosophy

Bashellit is intentionally simple.

It is designed for **writing** Bash scripts, not for replacing a full IDE or automating script execution. The goal is to stay lightweight, fast, and predictable while covering the essentials needed for everyday shell scripting.

## Features

- Simple and clean interface
- Syntax highlighting for Bash
- Code formatting
- Centralized storage for your Bash scripts
- One-click access to open a terminal at the script location

Bashellit does **not** execute scripts directly. Instead, when a script is open, you can click the **Open Terminal** button to launch a shell in the script’s directory and run it manually. This keeps execution explicit and under your control.

## What Bashellit Is Not

- A full IDE
- A script runner or automation tool (at least for now)
- A replacement for advanced editors like VS Code

Bashellit focuses on clarity and simplicity over feature density.

## Technology

Bashellit is a fully local application. It does not store or transmit any user data.

It is built using:

- **Tauri**
- **React**
- **Rust**

This combination keeps the application small, fast, and secure.

## Roadmap

Planned improvements include:

- Multilingual support
- General usability and performance improvements
- Additional quality-of-life features, while keeping the tool lightweight

## Screenshots

Screenshots will be added soon.
